<h1>Internet Course - Exercise 4</h1>

<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>The submission is a WebStorm project that can be run directly from the IDE.</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The site use bootstrap CDN therefore assumes an internet connection is available.</br>
    The site uses an API service, therefore assumes the server is up and internet connection is available.</br>
    The site is based on NodeJS Express, therefore assumes that the command "npm install" has taken place.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The project is a NodeJS Express project.</p>
<p>Before running the project, the command "npm install" must take place.</p>
<p>The project divided to few folders: public, routes and views (and other folders related to database).</br>
The public folder contains images, stylesheets and all the client-side javascripts.</br>
The routes folder contains all the server-side javascripts, include the router commands.</br>
The views folder contains all the "Dynamic HTML" ejs pages, which will be the outcome which the user will see.</p>
<p>The API we have used contain some shortcuts for weathers that we do not know.</br>
Therefore, we have translated the shortcuts that we did figure out, and left the others as is.</p>

<h2>Behaviours</h2>
<p>We have set up few spacial behaviours in the website:
<ul>
    <li>When signing up, names should contain ONLY English letters.</li>
    <li>Every address entered after localhost:3000/ will force a redirect and will present the login page.</li>
    <li>If one user is logged in, any tries to register/login in a new tab will be redirected to weather page of the first user.</li>
    <li>If two tabs are open at the weather page of a user, logging out in one of them will cause an </br>
        immediate stop of database actions on the other tab. All client side functions will work, but nothing will be saved.</li>
    <li>If a user logging off, no one can make database changes until a user is logging in.</li>
    <li>Bottom line- only ONE user can be online!</li>
</ul></p>
